## Flags:
***Flags have been introduced to add visual indicators for Talkgroups (TG) or DMR IDs. To enable flags for specific TGs or DMR IDs, follow these steps:***

- If you see the world flag flickering in the `lastheard`, `Linked systems`, etc. tables, you need to add or copy a new flag image in the `flags` folder.
- The flag image should be named with the first three digits of the Talkgroup or DMR ID.
- For example, if the Talkgroup is 12345678, place a file called `123.png` in the `flags` folder.

## Repeaters, Hotspots, and Bridges:
***The dashboard now distinguishes between Repeaters, Hotspots, and Bridges based on their DMR IDs and/or TX/RX frequency.***

- If a DMR ID has 6 digits, it is considered a Repeater and will be displayed in the `Repeaters` table.
- If a DMR ID has 7 digits or more and has a TX/RX frequency associated with it, it is recognized as a Hotspot and will be shown in the `Hotspots` table.
- If a DMR ID has 7 digits or more and has a TX/RX frequency of 0 (zero), it is identified as a Bridge and will appear in the `Bridges` table.
